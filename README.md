# Dates & Intervals Project
## General
- I made this project with C++, as a part of my B.Sc in Computer Science, in OOP Course.
- The project's ideas is the investigate and compare between dates and intervals using OOP focusing on Polymorphism, Exceptions and Templates.
- There are 3 diffrent functions in the main.cpp which are not related to each other, the first two are related to dates build and compare, and the third is related to comparing between intervals, FYI.

## Dates
### Possabilities
- Available operators are : '==','<=','>=','!=','>','<' (from IComparable) and '='.
- Input (string) / Output are supported.
- There are 4 values for each date:
    1. Day
    2. Month
    3. Year
    4. ErrorID - which will print the error of the date if necessary.

## Intervals
### Possabilities
- Available operators are : '&&', '||'.
- Ouput is supported.
- There are only 2 values for each interval:
    1. Start
    2. End

** As a test, you may run main.cpp to investigate all included functions **
